# Matrix.cpp

A simple mathematical matrix class written in C++ to be reused for future 
assignments in my Computational Linear Algebra class. The Matrix class comes 
loaded with basic operations such as addition, multiplication, element access, 
input and output, identity matrix creation, and simple linear system solving 
methods.
